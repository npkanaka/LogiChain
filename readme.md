# LogiChain Agent

LogicChain is an intelligent reasoning agent designed to enhance logical reasoning tasks by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with symbolic solvers. By translating natural language statements into symbolic logic and leveraging external solvers, LogicChain pushes the boundaries of deductive reasoning, setting a new standard for accuracy and efficiency.

## Overview

Recent advancements in LLMs have shown great potential in logical reasoning, but pure LLM approaches struggle with complex deductive tasks. LogicChain addresses this by acting as an intermediary, translating natural language into symbolic representations that are compatible with high-performance symbolic solvers like **Z3**. This hybrid approach not only increases accuracy but also makes complex reasoning more tractable.
